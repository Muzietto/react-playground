# Basic setup
This project setups up a basic website with two pages within the route and a
default page if the route is not found.

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Match
This looks at the location and using a Regular Expression will show the
associated component specified within the component Prop.

## Miss
This is the component to display if the route didn't match.
