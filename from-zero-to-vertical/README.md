# React Playground - from-zero-to-vertical

## 00-wireframe

## Usage

- npm install

## Available task

- `npm start`: will launch the app in hot reloading with webpack-dev-server
- `npm run watch`: alternative to `npm start`, will watch for code changes and will build the app inside `/dist` folder. Useful if you want to serve it with your own web server.
- `npm run build`: will create the build inside `/dist` folder.

## Before all this

- be aware of http://eit-confluence-p.edenred.net/display/WEL/PCEW+-+Documentazione+front-end

- visit https://the-echoplex.net/flexyboxes/ and experiment a bit

- a few words on atomic design (also in Confluence)

## Tasks

Examine VerticalHrPage and:

- add a custom page body starting from verticalHrPageBody

- experiment with insertion of TopNavigation and Header (use classes instead of inline styles; add some properties like page title and user profiles)

- implement the VerticalPageTemplate component and use it
